### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics discussed in the labs prepared to complete this assignment kind of by helping me learn how to fetch data using an API. The labs made me feel prepared but not as much. The instructor Devarsh was the biggest help with his live demos and videos about the pokemon demo.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time I would have added a like button to the moviecard so that users could like their favorite movies. 

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Things that went well were the search bar and the desing of the movie card with all the information deployed. Things that did not go as planned were fetching the information from the API since at first it was duplicating the information but I managed to get it fixed and the load more button since it was reloading a new page instead of loading more information at the bottom. Something that I saw that my peer did that I would like to implement is styling more my header.
